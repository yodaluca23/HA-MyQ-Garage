# Miminal MyQ Garage Door
This is a Home Assistant custom component that integrates MyQ garage door openers with minimal functionality. It provides basic control and monitoring of MyQ garage doors using the `mypyq` library.

## Notice
This is a custom integration I made for my personal use, is not an official Home Assistant integration, is probably not fully tested or supported, and WILL have bugs or missing features. Use at your own risk.
